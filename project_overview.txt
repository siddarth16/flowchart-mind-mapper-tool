The Ultimate Free Lucidchart Alternative – Flow/Mind Map Builder

OBJECTIVE

Build a fully-featured, online flowchart and mind map builder that is a true alternative to Lucidchart - https://www.lucidchart.com/ , with every single feature (including premium/AI), unlimited usage, and a beautiful, dark-themed, professional-grade user interface.
The app must be 100% free, require no login, and be fully open-source, with all code in my connected GitHub repo, and live for the world to use.

CORE REQUIREMENTS

    Feature Parity with Lucidchart

        Flowchart Creation: Drag-and-drop shapes (boxes, circles, diamonds, connectors/arrows, lines, images, icons, etc.)

        Mind Maps: Tree/branch mode, unlimited nesting, auto-layout

        Templates Library: Ready-made org charts, flowcharts, swimlanes, UML, network diagrams, ERDs, etc.

        Multi-Page Documents: Tabbed navigation for multiple diagrams

        Layers/Groups: Lock, group, hide/reveal, z-order

        Custom Styling: Colors, gradients, borders, shadows, fonts, shapes, icons, custom backgrounds

        Import/Export: Export as PDF, PNG, SVG, and editable JSON; Import Lucidchart/Visio/Miro files if possible

        Collaboration (optional): Real-time collab (using yjs or similar, only if fits free-tier/no backend cost)

        Undo/Redo, Version History

        Infinite Canvas with Pan & Zoom

        Smart Connectors: Auto-routing lines, snapping, magnet points, bend points

        Snap-to-Grid, Alignment Guides

        Keyboard Shortcuts

        Mobile and Tablet Responsive UI

    Advanced/AI Features

        AI Auto-Layout: Automatically arrange messy diagrams

        AI Diagram Generator: User describes diagram in text, AI generates flowchart/mind map (use free in-browser LLM, WebLLM, or local HuggingFace.js models)

        Smart Suggestions: Suggest next nodes/shapes as you build (AI-powered)

        Text Summarization: Select a node or area, AI can summarize its content

        OCR to Flowchart: User uploads a photo/sketch, AI parses and turns it into editable shapes (if possible, using in-browser tesseract.js for OCR)

        Auto-formatting/Prettify Button: Beautify diagram with a single click

    Modern, Professional Dark-Themed UI

        Use a gorgeous, contemporary dark UI by default (glassmorphism/neumorphism welcome but keep pro vibes)

        Highlighted colors, gradients, soft glow accents, crisp icons

        Minimal topbar/sidebar, collapsible tool panels, floating context menus

        Animated transitions, drag-and-drop feedback, smooth zoom/pan

        Professional fonts and spacing (Inter, Roboto, or similar)

        Custom logo, favicon, and landing page

    No Login, No Limits, No Cost

        No sign up, no paywalls, no hidden tricks

        Works 100% in-browser; for any server-side needed, use only free, open-source backends (deploy on Render/Vercel/Cloudflare, never paid APIs)

        Unlimited diagrams, unlimited exports

    Free Hosting & Open Source

        All code committed to my GitHub repo

        Deployed on a free hosting service (Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare)

        Site must be public and accessible worldwide

    Privacy First

        No analytics, no tracking, no cookies (unless essential for local storage/undo)

        All user data stays in-browser, unless collaborating (then only using free, privacy-first backends)

    Accessibility & Documentation

        Fully accessible UI (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, high contrast, screen reader friendly)

        README that explains all features, supported file types, stack, and privacy stance

SPECIFIC TASKS & INSTRUCTIONS

    Survey Lucidchart and List All Features

        Create a checklist covering every Lucidchart (and similar tool) feature.

        Mark as “included”, “in-progress”, or “not possible” (explain why).

    Frontend

        Build with React or another high-performance frontend

        Use React Flow, Drawflow, or similar for the core canvas/diagramming

        Apply a premium, pro-grade dark theme, with glowing accent colors and interactive panels

    AI Features

        Use open-source, in-browser models for LLM/diagram generation (WebLLM, Huggingface.js, Tesseract.js, etc.)

        No paid OpenAI or third-party API calls

    Backend (if collaboration is implemented)

        Use only free-tier, open-source collaborative tools (yjs/Liveblocks free tier, or similar)

        Otherwise, keep all processing local/in-browser

    Export/Import

        Export to PDF, PNG, SVG (in-browser), and editable JSON

        Import/export Lucidchart/Visio if feasible (parse with OSS libraries)

    Performance

        Fast load, no jank; support for big, complex diagrams

        Use Web Workers for heavy AI/layout/parse tasks
